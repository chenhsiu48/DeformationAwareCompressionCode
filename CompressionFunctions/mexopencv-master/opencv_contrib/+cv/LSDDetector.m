    % ## Lines extraction methodology
    %
    % The lines extraction methodology described in the following is mainly
    % based on [EDL]. The extraction starts with a Gaussian pyramid generated
    % from an original image, downsampled N-1 times, blurred N times, to
    % obtain N layers (one for each octave), with layer 0 corresponding to
    % input image. Then, from each layer (octave) in the pyramid, lines are
    % extracted using LSD algorithm.
    %
    % Differently from `EDLine` lines extractor used in original article, LSD
    % furnishes information only about lines extremes; thus, additional
    % information regarding slope and equation of line are computed via
    % analytic methods. The number of pixels is obtained using
    % cv.LineIterator. Extracted lines are returned in the form of `KeyLine`
    % objects, but since extraction is based on a method different from the
    % one used in cv.BinaryDescriptor class, data associated to a line's
    % extremes in original image and in octave it was extracted from,
    % coincide. `KeyLine`'s field `class_id` is used as an index to indicate
    % the order of extraction of a line inside a single octave.

            %       variant of the method, `keylines{i}` is a set of keylines

            %       * **class_id** object ID, that can be used to cluster
            %             keylines by the line they represent.
            %       * __octave__ octave (pyramid layer), from which the
            %             keyline has been extracted.
            %       * __pt__ coordinates of the middlepoint `[x,y]`.
            %       * __response__ the response, by which the strongest
            %             keylines have been selected. It's represented by the
            %             ratio between line's length and maximum between
            %             image's width and height.

            %       * __startPointInOctave__ the start point of the line in
            %             the octave it was extracted from `[x,y]`.
            %       * __endPointInOctave__ the end point of the line in the

            %       * __lineLength__ the length of line.
            %       * __numOfPixels__ number of pixels covered by the line.
            %
            % ## Options

            % * __NumOctaves__ number of octaves inside pyramid. default 1
            % * __Mask__ optional mask matrix to detect only `KeyLines` of
            %       interest. It must be a logical or 8-bit integer matrix
            %       with non-zero values in the region of interest. In the
            %       second variant, it is a cell-array of masks for each
            %       input image, `masks{i}` is a mask for `imgs{i}`.
            %       Not set by default.
            %
            % `KeyLine` is a struct to represent a line.
            %
            % As aformentioned, it is been necessary to design a class that
            % fully stores the information needed to characterize completely a
            % line and plot it on image it was extracted from, when required.
            %
            % `KeyLine` class has been created for such goal; it is mainly
            % inspired to Feature2d's `KeyPoint` class, since `KeyLine` shares
            % some of `KeyPoint`'s fields, even if a part of them assumes a
            % different meaning, when speaking about lines. In particular:
            %
            % - the `class_id` field is used to gather lines extracted from
            %   different octaves which refer to same line inside original
            %   image (such lines and the one they represent in original image
            %   share the same `class_id` value)
            % - the `angle` field represents line's slope with respect to
            %   (positive) X axis
            % - the `pt` field represents line's midpoint
            % - the `response` field is computed as the ratio between the
            %   line's length and maximum between image's width and height
            % - the `size` field is the area of the smallest rectangle
            %   containing line
            %
            % Apart from fields inspired to `KeyPoint` class, `KeyLines`
            % stores information about extremes of line in original image and
            % in octave it was extracted from, about line's length and number
            % of pixels it covers.
