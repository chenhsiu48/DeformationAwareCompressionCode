%ESTIMATEPOSESINGLEMARKERS  Pose estimation for single markers
%
%    [rvecs, tvecs] = cv.estimatePoseSingleMarkers(corners, markerLength, cameraMatrix, distCoeffs)
%
% ## Input
% * __corners__ cell array of already detected markers corners. For each
%       marker, its four corners are provided, (e.g `{{[x,y],..}, ..}`). The
%       order of the corners should be clockwise.
% * __markerLength__ the length of the markers' side. The returning
%       translation vectors will be in the same unit. Normally, unit is meters.
% * __cameraMatrix__ input 3x3 floating-point camera matrix
%       `A = [fx 0 cx; 0 fy cy; 0 0 1]`.
% * __distCoeffs__ vector of distortion coefficients
%       `[k1,k2,p1,p2,k3,k4,k5,k6,s1,s2,s3,s4]` of 4, 5, 8 or 12 elements.
%
% ## Output
% * __rvecs__ cell array of output rotation vectors (e.g. `{[x,y,z], ...}`).
%       Each element in `rvecs` corresponds to the specific marker in
%       `corners`.
% * __tvecs__ cell array of output translation vectors (e.g. `{[x,y,z], ...}`).
%       Each element in `tvecs` corresponds to the specific marker in
%       `corners`.
%
% This function receives the detected markers and returns their pose
% estimation respect to the camera individually. So for each marker, one
% rotation and translation vector is returned. The returned transformation is
% the one that transforms points from each marker coordinate system to the
% camera coordinate system. The marker corrdinate system is centered on the
% middle of the marker, with the Z axis perpendicular to the marker plane.
% The coordinates of the four corners of the marker in its own coordinate
% system are:
%
%    (-markerLength/2, markerLength/2, 0),
%    (markerLength/2, markerLength/2, 0),
%    (markerLength/2, -markerLength/2, 0),
%    (-markerLength/2, -markerLength/2, 0)
