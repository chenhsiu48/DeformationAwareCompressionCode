%FASTHOUGHTRANSFORM  Calculates 2D Fast Hough transform of an image
%
%    dst = cv.FastHoughTransform(src)
%    dst = cv.FastHoughTransform(src, 'OptionName',optionValue, ...)
%
% ## Input
% * __src__ The source (input) image.
%
% ## Output
% * __dst__ The destination image, result of transformation.
%
% ## Options
% * __DDepth__ The depth of destination image. Default `int32`.
% * __Op__ The operation to be applied.
%       This specifies binary operations, that is such ones which involve two
%       operands. Formally, a binary operation `f` on a set `S` is a binary
%       relation that maps elements of the Cartesian product `SxS` to `S`:
%       `f: SxS -> S`. Default 'Addition'. One of
%       * __Minimum__ Binary minimum operation. The constant specifies the
%             binary minimum operation `f` that is defined as follows:
%             `f(x, y) = min(x, y)`.
%       * __Maximum__ Binary maximum operation. The constant specifies the
%             binary maximum operation `f` that is defined as follows:
%             `f(x, y) = max(x, y)`.
%       * __Addition__ Binary addition operation. The constant specifies the
%             binary addition operation `f` that is defined as follows:
%             `f(x, y) = x + y`.
%       * __Average__ Binary average operation. The constant specifies the
%             binary average operation `f` that is defined as follows:
%             `f(x, y) = (x + y)/2`.
% * __AngleRange__ The part of Hough space to calculate.
%       This specifies the part of Hough space to calculate. Each member
%       specifies primarily direction of lines (horizontal or vertical) and
%       the direction of angle changes. Direction of angle changes is from
%       multiples of 90 to odd multiples of 45. The image considered to be
%       written top-down and left-to-right. Angles are started from vertical
%       line and go clockwise. Separate quarters and halves are written in
%       orientation they should be in full Hough space. Default `ARO_315_135`.
%       One of:
%       * **ARO_0_45** Vertical primarily direction and clockwise angle
%             changes.
%       * **ARO_45_90** Horizontal primarily direction and counterclockwise
%             angle changes.
%       * **ARO_90_135** Horizontal primarily direction and clockwise angle
%             changes.
%       * **ARO_315_0** Vertical primarily direction and counterclockwise
%             angle changes.
%       * **ARO_315_45** Vertical primarily direction.
%       * **ARO_45_135** Horizontal primarily direction.
%       * **ARO_315_135** Full set of directions.
%       * **ARO_CTR_HOR** `90 +/- atan(0.5)`, interval approximately from
%             `64.5` to `116.5` degrees. It is used for calculating Fast Hough
%             Transform for images skewed by `atan(0.5)`.
%       * **ARO_CTR_VER** `0 +/- atan(0.5)`, interval approximately from
%             `333.5` (`-26.5`) to `26.5` degrees. It is used for calculating
%             Fast Hough Transform for images skewed by `atan(0.5)`.
% * __MakeSkew__ Specifies to do or not to do skewing of Hough transform
%       image. The enum specifies to do or not to do skewing of Hough
%       transform image so it would be no cycling in Hough transform image
%       through borders of image. Default 'Deskew'. One of:
%       * __Raw__ Use raw cyclic image.
%       * __Deskew__ Prepare deskewed image.
%
% The function calculates the fast Hough transform for full, half or quarter
% range of angles.
