%    [corners, ids] = cv.detectMarkers(img, dictionary)
%    [corners, ids, rejectedImgPoints] = cv.detectMarkers(img, dictionary)
%    [...] = cv.detectMarkers(..., 'OptionName',optionValue, ...)
%
% ## Input
% * __img__ input image (8-bit grayscale or color).
% * __dictionary__ indicates the type of markers that will be searched.
%       You can specify the dictionary as a cell-array that starts with the
%       type name followed by option arguments `{Type, ...}`.
%       There are three types of dictionaries available:
%       * __Predefined__ `{'Predefined', name}` or simply as a string `name`.
%             Returns one of the predefined dictionaries.
%       * __Custom__ `{'Custom', nMarkers, markerSize, 'BaseDictionary',baseDict}`.
%             Generates a new customizable marker dictionary. This creates a
%             new dictionary composed by `nMarkers` markers and each markers
%             composed by `markerSize*markerSize` bits. If `BaseDictionary` is
%             provided, its markers are directly included and the rest are
%             generated based on them. If the size of `baseDict` is higher
%             than `nMarkers`, only the first `nMarkers` in `baseDict` are
%             taken and no new marker is added.
%       * __Manual__ `{'Manual', bytesList, markerSize, maxCorrectionBits}`.
%             Creates a dictionary/set of markers manually. It contains the
%             inner codification.
%
% ## Output
% * __corners__ cell array of detected marker corners. For each marker, its
%       four corners are provided `{{[x1,y1],[x2,y2],[x3,y3],[x4,y4]}, ..}`.
%       The order of the corners is clockwise.
% * __ids__ vector of identifiers of the detected markers. The identifier is
%       of integer type (0-based). For N detected markers, the size of ids is
%       also N. The identifiers have the same order than the markers in the
%       `corners` array.
% * __rejectedImgPoints__ contains the `corners` of those squares whose
%       inner code has not a correct codification. Useful for debugging
%       purposes.
%
% ## Options
% * __DetectorParameters__ marker detection parameters. A struct of
%       parameters for the detection process, with the following fields:
%       * __adaptiveThreshWinSizeMin__ minimum window size for adaptive
%             thresholding before finding contours (default 3).

%             finding contours (default 7)
%       * __minMarkerPerimeterRate__ determine minimum perimeter for marker
%             contour to be detected. This is defined as a rate respect to the

%       * __maxMarkerPerimeterRate__ determine maximum perimeter for marker
%             contour to be detected. This is defined as a rate respect to the
%             maximum dimension of the input image (default 4.0).

%             polygonal approximation process to determine which contours are
%             squares (default 0.03).
%       * __minCornerDistanceRate__ minimum distance between corners for
%             detected markers relative to its perimeter (default 0.05)
%       * __minDistanceToBorder__ minimum distance of any corner to the image
%             border for detected markers (in pixels) (default 3)
%       * __minMarkerDistanceRate__ minimum mean distance beetween two marker
%             corners to be considered similar, so that the smaller one is
%             removed. The rate is relative to the smaller perimeter of the
%             two markers (default 0.05).
%       * __doCornerRefinement__ do subpixel refinement or not (default false).
%       * __cornerRefinementWinSize__ window size for the corner refinement
%             process (in pixels) (default 5).

%             stop criteria of the corner refinement process (default 30).
%       * __cornerRefinementMinAccuracy__ minimum error for the stop cristeria
%             of the corner refinement process (default 0.1)
%       * __markerBorderBits__ number of bits of the marker border, i.e.

%       * __maxErroneousBitsInBorderRate__ maximum number of accepted
%             erroneous bits in the border (i.e. number of allowed white bits
%             in the border). Represented as a rate respect to the total
%             number of bits per marker (default 0.35).
%       * __minOtsuStdDev__ minimun standard deviation in pixels values during
%             the decodification step to apply Otsu thresholding (otherwise,
%             all the bits are set to 0 or 1 depending on mean higher than 128
%             or not) (default 5.0)
%       * __errorCorrectionRate__error correction rate respect to the maximum
%             error correction capability for each dictionary. (default 0.6).
%
% ## Inputs for Predefined Dictionary
% * __name__ name of predefined markers dictionaries/sets. Each dictionary
%       indicates the number of bits and the number of markers contained:
%       * `4x4_50`, `4x4_100`, `4x4_250`, `4x4_1000`: 4x4 bits with
%         (50|100|250|1000) markers.
%       * `5x5_50`, `5x5_100`, `5x5_250`, `5x5_1000`: 5x5 bits with
%         (50|100|250|1000) markers.
%       * `6x6_50`, `6x6_100`, `6x6_250`, `6x6_1000`: 6x6 bits with
%         (50|100|250|1000) markers.
%       * `7x7_50`, `7x7_100`, `7x7_250`, `7x7_1000`: 7x7 bits with
%         (50|100|250|1000) markers.
%       * `ArucoOriginal`: standard ArUco Library Markers.
%         1024 markers, 5x5 bits, 0 minimum distance.
%
% ## Inputs for Custom Dictionary
% * __nMarkers__ number of markers in the dictionary.
% * __markerSize__ number of bits per dimension of each markers.
% * __baseDict__ (Optional) include the markers in this dictionary at the
%       beginning. It is specified in the same format as the parent dictionary
%       (i.e. a cell-array `{Type, ...}`).
%
% ## Inputs for Manual Dictionary
% * __bytesList__ marker code information. Note that the `bytesList` is given
%       in the form of a matrix of bits which is then converted to list of
%       bytes in the 4 rotations using `Dictionary::getByteListFromBits`.
%       It contains the marker codewords where:
%       * the number of rows is the dictionary size
%       * each marker is encoded using `nbytes = ceil(markerSize*markerSize/8)`
%       * each row contains all 4 rotations of the marker, so its length is
%         `4*nbytes`
%       * `bytesList(i,k*nbytes+j)` is then the j-th byte of i-th marker, in
%         its k-th rotation.
% * __markerSize__ number of bits per dimension.
% * __maxCorrectionBits__ maximum number of bits that can be corrected.
%
% The cv.detectMarkers function performs marker detection in the input image.
% Only markers included in the specific dictionary are searched. For each
% detected marker, it returns the 2D position of its corner in the image and
% its corresponding identifier. Note that this function does not perform pose
% estimation.
%
% # ArUco Marker Detection
%
% This module is dedicated to square fiducial markers (also known as Augmented
% Reality Markers). These markers are useful for easy, fast and robust camera
% pose estimation.
%
% The main functionalities are:
%
% - Detection of markers in a image
% - Pose estimation from a single marker or from a board/set of markers
% - Detection of ChArUco board for high subpixel accuracy
% - Camera calibration from both, ArUco boards and ChArUco boards.
% - Detection of ChArUco diamond markers
%
% The implementation is based on the ArUco Library [2] by [1].
%
% This module has been originally developed by Sergio Garrido-Jurado as a
% project for Google Summer of Code 2015 (GSoC 15).
%
% ### ArUco
%
% ArUco markers are easy to detect pattern grids that yield up to 1024
% different patterns. They were built for augmented reality and later used for
% camera calibration. Since the grid uniquely orients the square, the
% detection algorithm can determing the pose of the grid.
%
% ### ChArUco
%
% ArUco markers were improved by interspersing them inside a checkerboard
% called ChArUco. Checkerboard corner intersectionsa provide more stable
% corners because the edge location bias on one square is countered by the
% opposite edge orientation in the connecting square. By interspersing ArUco
% markers inside the checkerboard, each checkerboard corner gets a label which
% enables it to be used in complex calibration or pose scenarios where you
% cannot see all the corners of the checkerboard.
%
% The smallest ChArUco board is 5 checkers and 4 markers called a
% "Diamond Marker".
