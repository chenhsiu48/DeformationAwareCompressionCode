    %DTREES  Decision Trees
    %
    % The class represents a single decision tree or a collection of decision
    % trees.
    %
    % The current public interface of the class allows user to train only a
    % single decision tree, however the class is capable of storing multiple
    % decision trees and using them for prediction (by summing responses or
    % using a voting schemes), and the derived from cv.DTrees classes (such as
    % cv.RTrees and cv.Boost) use this capability to implement decision tree
    % ensembles.
    %
    % ## Decision Trees
    %
    % The ML classes discussed in this section implement Classification and
    % Regression Tree algorithms described in [Breiman84].
    %
    % The class cv.DTrees represents a single decision tree or a collection of
    % decision trees. It's also a base class for cv.RTrees and cv.Boost.
    %
    % A decision tree is a binary tree (tree where each non-leaf node has two
    % child nodes). It can be used either for classification or for regression.
    % For classification, each tree leaf is marked with a class label;
    % multiple leaves may have the same label. For regression, a constant is
    % also assigned to each tree leaf, so the approximation function is
    % piecewise constant.
    %
    % ### Predicting with Decision Trees
    %
    % To reach a leaf node and to obtain a response for the input feature
    % vector, the prediction procedure starts with the root node. From each
    % non-leaf node the procedure goes to the left (selects the left child
    % node as the next observed node) or to the right based on the value of a
    % certain variable whose index is stored in the observed node. The
    % following variables are possible:
    %
    % * **Ordered variables**. The variable value is compared with a threshold
    % that is also stored in the node. If the value is less than the
    % threshold, the procedure goes to the left. Otherwise, it goes to the
    % right. For example, if the weight is less than 1 kilogram, the procedure
    % goes to the left, else to the right.
    %
    % * **Categorical variables**. A discrete variable value is tested to see
    % whether it belongs to a certain subset of values (also stored in the
    % node) from a limited set of values the variable could take. If it does,
    % the procedure goes to the left. Otherwise, it goes to the right. For
    % example, if the color is green or red, go to the left, else to the
    % right.
    %
    % So, in each node, a pair of entities (`variable_index`,
    % `decision_rule (threshold/subset)`) is used. This pair is called a split
    % (split on the variable `variable_index`). Once a leaf node is reached,
    % the value assigned to this node is used as the output of the prediction
    % procedure.
    %
    % Sometimes, certain features of the input vector are missed (for example,
    % in the darkness it is difficult to determine the object color), and the
    % prediction procedure may get stuck in the certain node (in the mentioned
    % example, if the node is split by color). To avoid such situations,
    % decision trees use so-called surrogate splits. That is, in addition to
    % the best "primary" split, every tree node may also be split to one or
    % more other variables with nearly the same results.
    %
    % ### Training Decision Trees
    %
    % The tree is built recursively, starting from the root node. All training
    % data (feature vectors and responses) is used to split the root node. In
    % each node the optimum decision rule (the best "primary" split) is found
    % based on some criteria. In machine learning, gini "purity" criteria are
    % used for classification, and sum of squared errors is used for
    % regression. Then, if necessary, the surrogate splits are found. They
    % resemble the results of the primary split on the training data. All the
    % data is divided using the primary and the surrogate splits (like it is
    % done in the prediction procedure) between the left and the right child
    % node. Then, the procedure recursively splits both left and right nodes.
    % At each node the recursive procedure may stop (that is, stop splitting
    % the node further) in one of the following cases:
    %
    % * Depth of the constructed tree branch has reached the specified maximum
    %   value.
    % * Number of training samples in the node is less than the specified
    %   threshold when it is not statistically representative to split the
    %   node further.
    % * All the samples in the node belong to the same class or, in case of
    %   regression, the variation is too small.
    % * The best found split does not give any noticeable improvement compared
    %   to a random choice.
    %
    % When the tree is built, it may be pruned using a cross-validation
    % procedure, if necessary. That is, some branches of the tree that may
    % lead to the model overfitting are cut off. Normally, this procedure is
    % only applied to standalone decision trees. Usually tree ensembles build
    % trees that are small enough and use their own protection schemes against
    % overfitting.
    %
    % ### Variable Importance
    %
    % Besides the prediction that is an obvious use of decision trees, the
    % tree can be also used for various data analyses. One of the key
    % properties of the constructed decision tree algorithms is an ability to
    % compute the importance (relative decisive power) of each variable. For
    % example, in a spam filter that uses a set of words occurred in the
    % message as a feature vector, the variable importance rating can be used
    % to determine the most "spam-indicating" words and thus help keep the
    % dictionary size reasonable.
    %
    % Importance of each variable is computed over all the splits on this
    % variable in the tree, primary and surrogate ones. Thus, to compute
    % variable importance correctly, the surrogate splits must be enabled in
    % the training parameters, even if there is no missing data.

        % Cluster possible values of a categorical variable into
        % `K <= MaxCategories` clusters to find a suboptimal split.
        %
        % If a discrete variable, on which the training procedure tries to
        % make a split, takes more than `MaxCategories` values, the precise
        % best subset estimation may take a very long time because the
        % algorithm is exponential. Instead, many decision trees engines
        % (including our implementation) try to find sub-optimal split in this
        % case by clustering all the samples into `MaxCategories` clusters
        % that is some categories are merged together. The clustering is
        % applied only in `n > 2`-class classification problems for
        % categorical variables with `N > MaxCategories` possible values. In
        % case of regression and 2-class classification the optimal split can
        % be found efficiently without employing clustering, thus the
        % parameter is not used in these cases. Default value is 10.
        MaxCategories
        % The maximum possible depth of the tree.
        %
        % That is the training algorithms attempts to split a node while its
        % depth is less than `MaxDepth`. The root node has zero depth. The
        % actual depth may be smaller if the other termination criteria are
        % met (see the outline of the training procedure here), and/or if the
        % tree is pruned. Default value is `intmax`.

        % If the number of samples in a node is less than this parameter then
        % the node will not be split.

        % If all absolute differences between an estimated value in a node and

        % The parameter can be used to tune the decision tree preferences
        % toward a certain class. For example, if you want to detect some rare
        % anomaly occurrence, the training base will likely contain much more
        % normal cases than anomalies, so a very good classification
        % performance will be achieved just by considering every case as
        % normal. To avoid this, the priors can be specified, where the
        % anomaly probability is artificially increased (up to 0.5 or even
        % greater), so the weight of the misclassified anomalies becomes much
        % bigger, and the tree is adjusted properly.
        %
        % You can also think about this parameter as weights of prediction
        % categories which determine relative weights that you give to
        % misclassification. That is, if the weight of the first category is 1
        % and the weight of the second category is 10, then each mistake in
        % predicting the second category is equivalent to making 10 mistakes
        % in predicting the first category. Default value is empty matrix.

            %       for each sample. Some samples may be more important than
            %       others for training. You may want to raise the weight of
            %       certain classes to find the right balance between hit-rate

            %       default considers all variables as numerical (both input
            %       and output variables). In case there is only one output
            %       variable of integer type, it is considered categorical.
            %       You can also specify a cell-array of strings (or as one
            %       string of single characters, e.g 'NNNC'). Possible values:

            % * __TrainTestSplitCount__ divides the dataset into train/test
            %       sets, by specifying number of samples to use for the test
            %       set. By default all samples are used for the training set.
            % * __TrainTestSplitRatio__ divides the dataset into train/test
            %       sets, by specifying ratio of samples to use for the test
            %       set. By default all samples are used for the training set.

            %       train/test sets, specify whether to shuffle the samples.
            %       Otherwise samples are assigned sequentially (first train

            %       lines and lines staring with '#'. default 1
            % * __ResponseStartIdx__ Index of the first output variable. If
            %       -1, the function considers the last variable as the
            %       response. If the dataset only contains input variables and
            %       no responses, use `ResponseStartIdx = -2` and
            %       `ResponseEndIdx = 0`, then the output variables vector
            %       will just contain zeros. default -1
            % * __ResponseEndIdx__ Index of the last output variable + 1. If
            %       -1, then there is single response variable at
            %       `ResponseStartIdx`. default -1
            % * __VarTypeSpec__ The optional text string that specifies the

            %       `ord[n1-n2,n3,n4-n5,...]cat[n6,n7-n8,...]`. That is,
            %       variables from `n1` to `n2` (inclusive range), `n3`, `n4`
            %       to `n5` ... are considered ordered and `n6`, `n7` to
            %       `n8` ... are considered as categorical. The range
            %       `[n1..n2] + [n3] + [n4..n5] + ... + [n6] + [n7..n8]`
            %       should cover all the variables. If `VarTypeSpec` is not

            %         corresponding variable is considered categorical.
            %       * if there are several output variables, they are all
            %         considered as ordered. Errors are reported when
            %         non-numerical values are used.
            %       * if there is a single output variable, then if its values
            %         are non-numerical or are all integers, then it's
            %         considered categorical. Otherwise, it's considered
            %         ordered.
            % * __Delimiter__ The character used to separate values in each
            %       line. default ','
            % * __Missing__ The character used to specify missing
            %       measurements. It should not be a digit. Although it's a
            %       non-numerical value, it surely does not affect the
            %       decision of whether the variable ordered or categorical.
            %       default '?'
            % * __TrainTestSplitCount__ same as above.
