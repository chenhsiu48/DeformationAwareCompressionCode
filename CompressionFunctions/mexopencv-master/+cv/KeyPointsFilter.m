classdef KeyPointsFilter
    %KEYPOINTSFILTER  Methods to filter a vector of keypoints
    %
    % A keypoint is a data structure for salient point detectors.
    %
    % The struct stores a keypoint, i.e. a point feature found by one of many
    % available keypoint detectors, such as Harris corner detector, cv.FAST,
    % cv.StarDetector, cv.SURF, cv.SIFT, cv.FeatureDetector etc.
    %
    % The keypoint is characterized by the 2D position, scale (proportional to
    % the diameter of the neighborhood that needs to be taken into account),
    % orientation and some other parameters. The keypoint neighborhood is then
    % analyzed by another algorithm that builds a descriptor (usually
    % represented as a feature vector). The keypoints representing the same
    % object in different images can then be matched using
    % cv.DescriptorMatcher or another method.
    %
    % The keypoint struct contains the following fields:
    % * __pt__ coordinates of the keypoint `[x,y]`.
    % * __size__ diameter of the meaningful keypoint neighborhood.
    % * __angle__ computed orientation of the keypoint (-1 if not applicable);
    %       it's in [0,360) degrees and measured relative to image coordinate
    %       system, ie in clockwise.
    % * __response__ the response by which the most strong keypoints have been
    %       selected. Can be used for the further sorting or subsampling.
    % * __octave__ octave (pyramid layer) from which the keypoint has been
    %       extracted.
    % * **class_id** object class (if the keypoints need to be clustered by an
    %       object they belong to).
