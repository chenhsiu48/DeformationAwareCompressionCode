%EMDL1  Computes the "minimal work" distance between two weighted point configurations
%
%    dist = cv.EMDL1(signature1, signature2)
%
% ## Input
% * __signature1__ First signature, a single column floating-point matrix.
%       Each row is the value of the histogram in each bin.
% * __signature2__ Second signature of the same format and size as
%       `signature1`.
%
% ## Output
% * __dist__ output distance.
%
% Base on the papers [1] and [2].
