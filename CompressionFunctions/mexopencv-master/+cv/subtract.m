%SUBTRACT  Calculates the per-element difference between two arrays or array and a scalar
%
%    dst = cv.subtract(src1, src2)
%    dst = cv.subtract(src1, src2, 'OptionName',optionValue, ...)
%
% ## Input
% * __src1__ first input array or a scalar.
% * __src2__ second input array or a scalar.
%
% ## Output
% * __dst__ output array of the same size and number of channels as the input
%       array(s). The depth is defined by `DType` or that of `src1`/`src2`.
%
% ## Options
% * __Mask__ optional operation mask; this is an 8-bit single channel array
%       that specifies elements of the output array to be changed. Not set by
%       default.
% * __Dest__ Used to initialize the output `dst` when a mask is used. Not set
%       by default.
% * __DType__ optional depth of the output array: `uint8`, `int16`, `double`,
%       etc. (see the discussion below). Must be specified if input arrays are
%       of different types. default -1
%
% The function cv.subtract calculates:
%
% * Difference between two arrays, when both input arrays have the same size
%   and the same number of channels:
%
%        dst(I) = saturate(src1(I) - src2(I)) if mask(I) != 0
%
% * Difference between an array and a scalar, when `src2` is constructed from
%   Scalar or has the same number of elements as `size(src1,3)`:
%
%        dst(I) = saturate(src1(I) - src2) if mask(I) != 0
%
% * Difference between a scalar and an array, when `src1` is constructed from
%   Scalar or has the same number of elements as `size(src2,3)`:
%
%        dst(I) = saturate(src1 - src2(I)) if mask(I) != 0
%
% * The reverse difference between a scalar and an array in the case of
%   `SubRS`:
%
%        dst(I) = saturate(src2 - src1(I)) if mask(I) != 0
%
% where `I` is a multi-dimensional index of array elements. In case of
% multi-channel arrays, each channel is processed independently.
%
% The first function in the list above can be replaced with matrix expressions:
%
%    dst = src1 - src2;
%
% The input arrays and the output array can all have the same or different
% depths. For example, you can subtract to 8-bit unsigned arrays and store the
% difference in a 16-bit signed array. Depth of the output array is determined
% by `DType` parameter. In the second and third cases above, as well as in the
% first case, when `class(src1) == class(src2)`, `DType` can be set to the
% default -1. In this case the output array will have the same depth as the
% input array, be it `src1`, `src2` or both.
%
% Note: Saturation is not applied when the output array has the depth `int32`.
% You may even get result of an incorrect sign in the case of overflow.
